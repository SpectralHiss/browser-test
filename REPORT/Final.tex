\section{Introduction}

\subsection{motivation}
In recent years, there has been an explosion of thick client web architecture web applications,
which means a shift in the importance of this attack surface available to hackers that was previously overlooked or deemed \
less crutial than server logic or other serious network and server exploits.\\

When asked about Cross Site Scripting or Cross Site Request Forgery a lot of developers still regard\
these types of attacks not of paramount importance, even if they long surpassed the number of reported\
intrusions compared to SQL injections or other network attacks or attacks on server which are obviously of concern.\\

Besides developer negligence, the needs of the dynamic and vibrant web with HTML5 dominating has meant that browser vendors\
that delivered the specification the quickest has often had the edge, at the detriment of security considerations \
especially in the client side.\\

The Same Origin Policy was the first policy to mitigate security risks but it is dated and too restrictive to many web applications \
that might host features on subdomains or exhibiting inter-dependance on other web applications which is more and more common, as in mashups \cite{mashup} for example.\\

We will need to clarify the history of features and their support on browsers along with the potential problems entailed \
by the progressive rollout of standards like CORS, CSP which are still a work-in-progress due to the breadth of web technologies \
and evolving needs. While these mechanisms are meant to stop or make more difficult a class of attacks we arguably deal with a more \
serious type of defect in browser technology. Improper implementation of the standards.\\

BrowserAudit is a tool developed at Imperial College as part of a previous student's outstanding thesis, It has \
the express purpose of verifying integrity of security policies in browser, it's an aggregation of cutting-edge security considerations \ 
on the client-side. 
It is a useful tool for browser developers to along their unit tests for the implementation of those policies, and web developers to test their browsers\
It also contains experimental tests from proposed standards and hence is a good place to consider the direction web standards should be going towards in terms of securing the client-side.\


\subsection{objectives}

The purpose of this paper is to briefly explain the work of this tool and to build up on it in the direction of completeness and modularity \
the goal is to aleviate the tension between extensibility, completeness and usability, to know for a fact when using different browsers \
due to thorough  empirical testing the security of these browsers .\\


We also try to add a pedagogical aspect that ensures maximum usability and hence adoption by developers and security concientious users.\ 
Ultimately this means providing a risk analysis and expert knowlege breakdown that is informed by the data we progressively and systematically analyse by testing all the browsers in the wild.\\

At it's current state BrowserAudit is the starting point and cover some substantial ground already thanks to the work of c. Hothersall , and dr Sergio maffeis.
For the sake of clarity we lay the natural background information in a similar but different way than in \cite{maffeis}  we will discuss the selected features and extensions\
proposed future work section of that very paper, and precisely state our own proposals and the rationale behind them.\\

\subsection{Structure}
The remainder of this report consists of:
\begin{itemize}
 \item A General background section briefly explaining the web technologies involved in detail bla
 \item A review of browseraudit as it stands before the takeover for this thesis and discussing the direction we decided the research to take.
 \item Design and Implementation general design and implementation details.
 \item Tests technicalities where we go more in depth of the specific tests we added through our new interface.
 \item our Stretch goal: risk analysis for the developer and net 
 \item Evaluation
 \item Conclusion
\end{itemize}
